# Stock and Shipping Performance Analysis

Unveiling Shipping & Stock Performance Trends Through Data-Driven Insights

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize shipping and stock performance data using Tableau, uncovering key insights that can drive strategic business decisions. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, we identify trends, inefficiencies, and areas for optimization in the supply chain.

## 🏆 Key Objectives:

✔ Understand the efficiency of the shipping process.

✔ Identify delivery bottlenecks and optimize stock management.

✔ Provide data-driven recommendations to improve operational performance.

## 🧐 Background Problem

Efficient shipping and stock management are crucial for ensuring customer satisfaction and smooth business operations. However, challenges in delivery efficiency and inventory control can lead to delays, cancellations, and stockouts, affecting overall business performance.

## 📌 Problem Statement

How efficient is the current shipping process, and what optimizations can be made in stock management to reduce undelivered orders?

## SMART Breakdown:

✅ **Specific** – Identify inefficiencies in shipping and stock processes.

✅ **Measurable** – Increase the percentage of successfully delivered orders.

✅ **Achievable** – Implement data-driven optimizations in logistics.

✅ **Relevant** – Direct impact on customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

✅ **Time-bound** – Target improvements within the next quarter.

## 📊 Analysis Breakdown

This project answers key business questions:

1️⃣ How efficient is the shipping process? (Analyzing order fulfillment rates and shipping delays.)

2️⃣ What is the average shipping time from order creation to delivery? (Using descriptive statistics to calculate time differences.)

3️⃣ What percentage of orders are successfully delivered compared to cancellations? (Visualizing order status distributions.)

4️⃣ Are there indications of stock mismanagement? (Examining undelivered orders as a potential inventory issue.)

5️⃣ How is the distribution of items per order? (Identifying customer purchasing behavior.)

6️⃣ Are there significant differences in shipping times based on order status? (Performing inferential statistical tests to detect variations.)

## 🛠️ Methods Used

📌 Descriptive Statistics – Understanding order trends and shipping efficiency.

📌 Inferential Statistics – Identifying significant variations in shipping times.

📌 Data Visualization – Communicating insights effectively through charts and dashboards.

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings

🔹 Shipping Efficiency – Only 65.04% of orders are shipped, and 35.16% successfully delivered, indicating significant drop-off in the final stage.

🔹 Average Shipping Time – 3.48 days, with most orders delivered within 3 to 4 days.

🔹 Order Cancellations & Returns – 1,814 orders were canceled, and 1,186 were returned, suggesting inefficiencies in stock and order processing.

🔹 Stock Management Issues – 34.96% of orders were never shipped, highlighting potential inventory mismanagement or fulfillment delays.

🔹 Customer Purchasing Behavior – The majority of orders contain only one item, presenting an opportunity for upselling and cross-selling strategies.

🔹 Shipping Time Variations – Orders marked as ‘Complete’ and ‘Shipped’ are fulfilled faster than ‘Processing’, ‘Cancelled’, or ‘Returned’ orders.

## 🎯 Recommendations

**Optimize Logistics & Delivery Process**

🔹 Strengthen partnerships with reliable shipping providers.

🔹 Implement real-time delivery tracking systems.

**Improve Inventory Management**

🔹 Implement real-time stock monitoring to prevent shortages.

🔹 Optimize restocking schedules based on demand patterns.

**Enhance Customer Experience**

🔹 Improve order status communication to reduce cancellations.

🔹 Streamline return policies and analyze reasons for product returns.

**Upselling & Cross-Selling Strategies**

🔹 Recommend complementary products to increase order size.

🔹 Offer bundle deals and discounts for bulk purchases.

**Warehouse Optimization**

🔹 Redesign warehouse layout to speed up order fulfillment.

🔹 Provide regular staff training to enhance efficiency.

**Continuous Monitoring & Analysis**

🔹 Conduct periodic reviews to refine business strategies.

## 🔍 Answer to the business question

**1. How Efficient is the Shipping Process?**

✅ **65.04% of orders are shipped**, but only **35.16% reach the customer**, indicating constraints in the final stages of delivery.  

**2. What is the Average Delivery Time? **

✅ Average **3.48 days**, majority within **3-4 days**, however there are delays up to **6-7 days**.  

**3. How Many Orders are Shipped, Accepted, Canceled and Returned?**  

✅ **3,567 shipped**, **3,010 received**, **1,814 canceled**, and **1,186 returned**, indicating stock issues.  

**4. Is There a Problem in Stock Management?**  

✅ **34.96% of orders were not delivered**, indicating stock mismatches or restocking delays.  

**5. How is the Distribution of Goods per Order?**  

✅ The majority of orders contain only **one item**, opening up **upselling & cross-selling** opportunities.  

**6. Does Delivery Time Differ Based on Order Status?**  

✅ **"Complete"** and **"Shipped"** orders are faster than **"Processing"**, **"Cancelled"**, and **"Returned”**.  

## 📌 Conclusion

Our analysis reveals that while shipping processes are functional, significant improvements are required in the final delivery stage and inventory control. By implementing these data-driven recommendations, businesses can enhance operational efficiency, reduce undelivered orders, and boost customer satisfaction.

## 💡 A well-optimized shipping and stock system is key to long-term business growth.
